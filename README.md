# spotifyMiniplaylist


This is a c++ project using header files to define classes. According to the user's type of homework, a small song playlist is exported to a text file, and spotify is launched where the uri's on that text file can be copied and accessed. To see the main() function, look at projectDriver.cp.

This project could be improved with a large music library database and working with spotify's API to allow automatic copying of the URI into the spotify browser.
